This section explains the necessary steps to make a submariner release.
It is assumed that you are familiar with the submariner project and the various repositories.

## Step 1: Create a Submariner Release

Assuming that you have an existing submariner git directory, the following steps create a release named "Globalnet Overlapping IP support RC0" with version v0.2.0-rc0 based on the master branch.

```bash
cd submariner
git stash
git remote add upstream ssh://git@github.com/submariner-io/submariner
git fetch -a -v -t upstream
git checkout remotes/upstream/master -B master
git tag -s -m "Globalnet Overlapping IP support RC0" v0.2.0-rc0
git push upstream v0.2.0-rc0
```

A tagged release should appear [here](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner/tags).

> <https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner/tags>

A build for v0.2.0-rc0 should start and appear under the "Active branches" section [here](https://travis-ci.com/github/submariner-io/submariner/branches).

> <https://travis-ci.com/github/submariner-io/submariner/branches>

Verify that the build successfully completes as indicated by a green checkmark at the right. At this point the images tagged with 0.2.0-rc0 will be available [here](https://quay.io/repository/submariner/submariner?tab=tags).

> <https://quay.io/repository/submariner/submariner?tab=tags>

## Step 2: Create a Lighthouse Release

To create lighthouse release artifacts follow the steps below.

### Build Lighthouse Agent and CoreDNS

Assuming that you have an existing lighthouse git directory, run the following steps .

```bash
cd lighthouse
git stash
git remote add upstream ssh://git@github.com/submariner-io/lighthouse
git fetch -a -v -t upstream
git checkout remotes/upstream/master -B master
git tag -s -m "Globalnet Overlapping IP support RC0" v0.2.0-rc0
git push upstream v0.2.0-rc0
```

A tagged release should appear [here](https://github.com/submariner-io/lighthouse/tags)

> <https://github.com/submariner-io/lighthouse/tags>

A build for v0.2.0-rc0 should start and appear under the "Active branches" section [here](https://travis-ci.com/github/submariner-io/lighthouse/branches)

> <https://travis-ci.com/github/submariner-io/lighthouse/branches>

For this example the build can be found [here](https://travis-ci.com/github/submariner-io/lighthouse/builds/153946391).

Verify that the build successfully completes as indicated by a green checkmark at the right. At this point the images tagged with 0.2.0-rc0 will be available on quay.io at:

> <https://quay.io/repository/submariner/lighthouse-agent?tab=tags>
> <https://quay.io/repository/submariner/lighthouse-coredns?tab=tags>

## Step 3: Update the Operator Version References and Create a Release

Once the other builds have finished and you have 0.2.0-rc0 release tags for the submariner and lighthouse projects, you can proceed with changes to the operator.

### Change Referenced Versions

Edit the operator [versions](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator/edit/master/pkg/versions/versions.go) file and change the project version constants to reference the new release, "0.2.0-rc0".

```bash
cd submariner-operator
git stash
git remote add upstream ssh://git@github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator
git fetch -a -v -t upstream
git checkout remotes/upstream/master -B update-references-to-v0.2.0-rc0
vim pkg/versions/versions.go
# make sure we are referencing the latest submariner code (we use it for verify-connectivity and the API)
GO111MODULES=on go get github.com/submariner-io/submariner@v0.2.0-rc0
git push my-repo update-references-to-v0.2.0-rc0
```

Create a pull request, wait for the CI job to pass, and get approval/merge. See an example PR [here](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator/pull/276)

### Create a Submariner-Operator Release

Assuming you have an existing submariner-operator git directory, run the following steps:

```bash
cd submariner-operator
git stash
git remote add upstream ssh://git@github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator
git fetch -a -v -t upstream
git checkout remotes/upstream/master -B master
git tag -s -m "Globalnet Overlapping IP support RC0" v0.2.0-rc0
git push upstream v0.2.0-rc0
```

A tagged release should appear [here](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator/tags).

> <https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator/tags>

A build for v0.2.0-rc0 should start and appear under the under the "Active branches" section [here](https://travis-ci.com/github/submariner-io/submariner-operator/branches).

> <https://travis-ci.com/github/submariner-io/submariner-operator/branches>

Verify that the build successfully completes as indicated by a green checkmark at the right.
At this point the images tagged with 0.2.0-rc0 will be available [here](https://quay.io/repository/submariner/submariner-operator?tab=tags).

> <https://quay.io/repository/submariner/submariner-operator?tab=tags>

### Verify the Subctl Binaries Release

At this point, you should see subctl binaries generated and listed for the various platforms under the [release](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator/tags), find the tag for v0.2.0-rc0 , verify that the binaries uploaded, the process needs around 5 minutes.

### Update the release notes

Go to <https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator/tags>, find the tag for v0.2.0-rc0 and select "Edit release" to the right.

Update the release notes.

If this is a pre-release, mark the checkbox "This is a pre-release".

If this is not a pre-release update [the release notes on the website](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-website/edit/master/src/content/releases/_index.en.md).
